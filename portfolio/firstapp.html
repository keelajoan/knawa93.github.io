            <p id="maininfo">
                For our final UX/UI project, our team of four collaborated to 
                design a social media app tailored for F.I.R.S.T. Institute students.
                The objective was to create the primary pages of the app, 
                focusing on the overall user experience and interface, 
                without delving into the more detailed individual pages 
                within the site's structure. Throughout the design process, 
                we adhered to F.I.R.S.T.'s brand guidelines to ensure 
                consistency and alignment with the institute's identity.

                <p>
                    Our group was responsible for designing 9 pages of an app. 
                    How we showed these in our designs is completely up to us 
                    and our group. This can be through links, buttons, icons, 
                    etc. These were the required pages.

                        <p>
                            As a design team, we divided the workload by 
                            assigning each member two pages to focus on. 
                            We agreed to independently conduct research and 
                            create wireframe sketches, ensuring that our 
                            designs were aligned with both the appâ€™s overall 
                            aesthetic and functionality. My primary 
                            responsibility was to lead the design for the 
                            sign-in page and the home page, while also 
                            researching the visual style and user experience 
                            elements that would unify the app.
                         </p> 
                            <p> To kick off the design process, I gathered 
                                inspiration from various sources to define the 
                                layout and user flow for both the sign-in and 
                                home pages. This allowed me to iterate and 
                                refine my ideas, which ultimately helped shape 
                                the low-fidelity wireframes and establish a 
                                solid foundation for our UI design.

                    These lo-fi sketches were developed based on our research
                     and served as a solid foundation for creating the mid-level 
                     wireframes. The insights gained during the research phase 
                     were instrumental in shaping the design direction and 
                     ensuring that the wireframes align with user needs and 
                     goals.

                        Here are the high-fidelity wireframes created by my group mates. You will notice a consistent layout throughout, as we collaborated and provided feedback to each other as a Scrum team. I contributed to finalizing the layout for the inbox page, and together we chose to create a ninth page for a "Create a Post" feature. We also included a prompt that asks, "Are you sure you want to leave?" if the user attempts to exit without creating a post.

                                        <p>
                                            These are the three accent colors 
                                            that are part of our client's brand, 
                                            we use them in about 30% and 20% of 
                                            our color choices, mostly on things 
                                            like buttons and the sign-in 
                                            background, we are glad about how 
                                            this turned out because we carefully 
                                            used the accent colors without 
                                            overpowering the main colors.

                                    We created our buttons based on the 
                                    neo-brutalism design aesthetic thick and 
                                    colorful, we made small and large buttons, 
                                    all used throughout the design, and we 
                                    maintained this style for all the buttons 
                                    and text boxes.

                                    We used icons in our design to make it easier to recognize than text. They convey meaning at a glance, allowing users to understand a function or action without reading lengthy descriptions. This makes the interface cleaner and more user-friendly, especially in spaces where screen real estate is limited.

      <h3>Prototype</h3>
      <p> Here is our final prototype, all nine pages were created, and we 
        mostly focused on the user interface, we did not create any personas 
        for this because we the students were the personas, so ideally we 
        concentrated on what we would like to see in a student app, 
        what kind of layout we would work and our user experience like, and I 
        think we achieved that. The look we went for was unique but still has 
        all the familiarities like layout, icons, and buttons, which are 
        universally used in social apps so a user would not experience a lot of 
        pain points.
